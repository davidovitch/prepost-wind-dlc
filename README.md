fatigue_tools has been based on work of Mads M Pedersen and David RS Verelst

prepost and cluster tools are created by David RS Verelst.

This repository holds a series of scripts and small libraries that aim to help
with the process of creating, managing, and post processing design load cases
(DLC's) simulations. Note that the work presented here has not been streamlined,
and is not easy to use nor easy installable. During the course of 2015 a 
library will be released with proper build, install and usage documentation.

The version that is included in this repository was extensively used within the
INDUFLAP project.
